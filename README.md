2. DVA232 Mobile Applications Group-8 project proposal:
  In this document, we will discuss our project idea for the mobile app “Tool for
  All”. The main idea behind this mobile application is to enable users to rent home
  tools for personal use.
  With this application:
  ● A user of the app you should be able to create an account, change your
  account credentials, and delete the account.
  
  ● When the account is created a user should also be able to Login to that
  account.
  
  ● Even if not logged in/registered, the user should be able to scroll through the
  collection of listings available in the app.
  
  ● As user of the app, if logged in, you should be able to publish new listings
  onto the app which will be visible to other users.
  
  ● The user should be able to rent items with the condition that they are logged
  in.
  
  ● The user should be able to view listings in more detail by clicking on them.
  
  ● Review the item by adding a comment (optional) after giving the item back.
  
  ● Even if not logged in/registered, the user should be able to contact the owner
  of the item, via information provided.
  
  ● To save time, the user should be able to search through listings.
